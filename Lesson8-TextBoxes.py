# ----------- Main Program Below -----------------

# Define the app
app = wx.App(False)

# Create a regular old wx.Frame
frame = HelloFrame(None)


# Make the app listen for clicks and other events
app.MainLoop()




# ----------- Exercises Below -----------------

#0. Remember to read through all the code and comments to at least get the basic idea before starting the exercises.

#1. What is the purpose of line 12? Write you answer below. Writing helps clearly identify answers.
#Answer:  __init__ is for running from the normal wx.Panel.

#2. The submit button is currently bound to a simple even handler called OnSubmitSimple.
#   But there is also a fancier event handler called OnSubmitComplex.
#   Change the binding on line 30 to use the fancier event handler and then run the program again.

#3. The last argument on line 58 is wx.OK That tells the program to include an "OK" button.
#   Change it from wx.OK to wx.CANCEL and see what happens.
#   Now change it to wx.OK | wx.CANCEL and see what happens.
#   We could handle the two button clicks differently if we wanted to (but we don't yet).

#4. This one is not related to text boxes or message boxes, but it is interesting.
#   We always call frame.Show() from our main program.
#   But really almost every frame should be shown as soon as it is created.
#   So we can move the show call to inside the constructor. Remove the frame.Show() from the main program
#   And put it inside the constructor. (Maybe somewhere near line 32)
#
#   Hint:
#   If you got an error it is probably because you just put the *exact* same line inside the constructor.
#   Ask your-SELF if the line needs to be modified at all.

#5. If the user doesn't enter a name, we can give them a default name.
#   Change the info message to "Hey, you didn't enter a name! I'll call you Dave."

#6. Good job on #5. It was a little easy. Now we need to actually call the user Dave.
#   wx.TextCtrl widgets have a method .SetValue("text here")
#   Use this message in the complex event handler to call the anonymous user Dave.

#7. It would be nice it Dave didn't have to click the submit button after we named him.
#   Even though OnSubmitComplex is an event handler, it can still be called just like any other function.
#   After we name him Dave, call self.OnSubmitComplex(None)
